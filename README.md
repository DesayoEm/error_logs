# Engineering Battle Logs

Welcome to my collection of mistakes, solutions, and debugging notes,
This repository documents errors and fixes I've encountered while working with different tools. If it blocked me, it's worth documenting.


I'd make here a joke about collecting bugs like infinity stones but gauntlets aren't my style and I weirdly only have 5 fingers on each hand.
They'd be too many to fit on one gauntlet anyway ðŸ’€.

## Why This Exists

* **Future debugging.** I come back here sometimes when I encounter the same errors again.
