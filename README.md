# Debugging logs

Welcome to my personal collection of mistakes, solutions, and debugging notes.

This repository documents errors and fixes I've encountered while working with different tools. 

No error is too small or insignificant. If it blocked me, it's worth documenting and could help someone too.

I'd throw in here a joke about collecting bugs like infinity stones but gauntlets  aren't my style and I weirdly only have 5 fingers on each hand🤦🏽‍♀️.

They'd be too many to fit on one gauntlet anyway 💀.

## Why This Exists

* **Future debugging.** I come back here sometimes when I encounter the same errors again.
* **Hopefully it helps someone.** 🤷🏽‍♀️
